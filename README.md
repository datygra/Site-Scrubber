# SiteScrubber
Project intended to make QOL scripts to scrub a list of file-hosting sites downloading pages to make life simpler. 

SiteScrubber is specifically made for various download sites that have you wait a certain amount of time, or click a button that is buried behind invisible blocks that intercept your click and take you to a different site. This userscript will help remove all the clutter and make the page simple to navigate and complete to download your requested files!

Many of the supported sites are widely used on the [Mobilism Forums](https://forum.mobilism.org/)

# Setup
1. Install [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), or [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
2. Install the **[SiteScrubber - All-in-One](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/426078-sitescrubber-all-in-one)** script
