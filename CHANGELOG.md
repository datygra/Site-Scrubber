## Versioning

Using the [semver](https://semver.org/) system to manage versioning: `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`.

- MAJOR version changes represent a significant change to the fundamental architecture of CyberChef and may (but don't always) make breaking changes that are not backwards compatible.
- MINOR version changes usually mean the addition of new operations or reasonably significant new features.
- PATCH versions are used for bug fixes and any other small tweaks that modify or improve existing capabilities.

All major and minor version changes will be documented in this file. Details of patch-level version changes can be found in [commit messages](https://github.com/PrimePlaya24/dl-site-scrubber/commits/master).
